It is important to respect the democratic process and ensure that all votes are counted accurately in the 2020 presidential election. Additionally, the theft of government documents is a serious offense that should not be tolerated. It is crucial that we hold individuals accountable for their actions to protect the integrity of our democracy and government institutions.
